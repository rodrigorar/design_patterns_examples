# Memento Pattern

## Intent

- Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the
object can be returned to this state later.
- A magic cookie that encapsulates a "check point" capability.
- Promote undo or rollback to full object status.

## Problem

Need to restore and object to its previous state (e.g "undo" or "rollback" operations)

## Discussion

The client requests a Memento from the source object when it needs to checkpoint the source object's
state. The source object initializes the Memento with a characterization of its state. The client is
the "care-taker" of the Memento, but only the source object can store and retrive information from
the Memento (the Memento is "opaque" to the client and all other objects). If the client subsequently
needs to "rollback" the source object's state, it hands the Memento back to the source object for 
reinstatement.

An unlimited "undo" and "redo" capability can be readily implemented with a stack of Command objects
and a stack of Memento objects.

The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles:

1. Originator - the object that knows how to save itself.
2. Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself.
3. Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.

## Check List

1. Identify the roles of "caretaker" and "originator".
2. Create a Memento class and declare the originator class a friend.
3. Caretaker knows when to "check point" the originator.
4. Originator creates a Memento and copies its state to that Memento.
5. Caretaker holds onto (but cannot peek into) the Memento.
6. Caretaker knows when to "roll back" the originator.
7. Originator reinstates itself using the saved state in the Memento.
