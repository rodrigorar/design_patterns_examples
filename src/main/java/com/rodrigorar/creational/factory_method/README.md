## Intent

- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Defining a "virtual" constructor.
- The new operator considered harmful.

## Problem

A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of applications,
but allow for individual applications to define their own domain objects and provide
for their instantiation.

## Discussion

Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to implementing an
algorithm. A superclass specifies all standard and generic behavior (using pure virtual
"placeholders" for creation steps), and then delegates the creation details to
subclasses that are supplied by the client.

Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more complicated.
Other design patterns require new classes, whereas Factory Method only requires
a new operation.

People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects; but it isn't
necessary if: the class that's instantiated never changes, or instantiation takes place
in an operation that subclasses can easily override (such as an initialization operation).

Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis of families.

Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework, and then
implemented by the user of the framework.

## Check List

1. If you have an inheritance hierarchy that exercises polymorphism, consider adding
a polymorphic creation capability by defining a static factory method in the base class.
2. Design the arguments to the factory method. What qualities or characteristics
are necessary and suficient to identify the correct derived class to instantiate?
3. Consider designing an internal "object pool" that will allow objects to be reused
instead of created from scrach.
4. Consider making all constructors private or protected
